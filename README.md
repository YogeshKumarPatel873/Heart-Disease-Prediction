# Heart Disease Prediction

## Introduction

This GitHub repository, **Heart-Disease-Prediction**, is dedicated to predicting heart disease using machine learning algorithms. The project utilizes a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which, though initially rough, has been thoroughly processed and analyzed to create an accurate heart disease prediction model. The primary objective of this project is to assist practitioners and medical analysts in diagnosing heart diseases more precisely.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains a wealth of information related to various factors and attributes that can contribute to heart disease. It includes features like age, sex, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and various others. These attributes are essential in determining the risk factors associated with heart diseases.

## Algorithms Used

Several machine learning algorithms have been implemented and tested on this dataset to predict heart disease. Some of the key algorithms used include:

1. **K Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** This algorithm is employed for its ability to classify individuals based on their similarity to others in the dataset.

2. **Logistic Regression:** Logistic regression is used to estimate the probability of a binary outcome, which, in this case, is whether an individual has heart disease or not.

3. **Random Forest Classifier:** Random forests are powerful ensemble methods that combine multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.

## How to Use

To utilize the heart disease prediction model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone` or download the ZIP file.

2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

3. Explore the Jupyter Notebook provided in the repository. It contains detailed code and explanations of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

4. Feel free to experiment with different algorithms and hyperparameters to fine-tune the model for your specific use case.

## Conclusion

The **Heart-Disease-Prediction** repository serves as a valuable resource for anyone interested in predicting heart diseases using machine learning. The analysis of various algorithms and the comprehensive dataset preprocessing make it a useful tool for both medical professionals and machine learning practitioners. By leveraging this repository, we hope to contribute to more accurate and early diagnoses of heart diseases, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
